## Create matrix with start-end-relationship

1. Create hexagon shapefile in QGIS (see wiki article *Create Hexagons with QGIS*) with required size and import it into PostgreSQL database
2. Set hexagon ID for start and end for each trip and export the result grouped by hexagon idÂ´s as csv with [Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.sql](Analysis/PostgreSQL/Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.sql). Modify table name of hexagons and schema if necessary!
3. Import csv to R and create matrix with [Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.R](Analysis/R/Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.R)
4. 

## Calculate shortest distance between grid points and vehicles
1. Create grid points in QGIS
2. Calculate shortest distance for all grid points to start positions of vehicles is a classical nearest neighbour problem, but running it as bulk on a whole table is a bit tricky and furthermore timeconsuming (adjust config settings, see [Wiki] (https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Performance-Optimization-of-PostgreSQL)
