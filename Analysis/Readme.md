## Create matrix with start-end-relationship

1. Create hexagon shapefile in QGIS (see wiki article *Create Hexagons with QGIS*) with required size and import it into PostgreSQL database
2. Set hexagon ID for start and end for each trip and export the result grouped by hexagon idÂ´s as csv with [Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.sql](PostgreSQL/Nearest_Neighbour.sql). Modify table name of hexagons and schema if necessary!
3. Import csv to R and create matrix with [Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.R](R/Hexagon_Matrix_Start_End.R)
4. 

## Calculate shortest distance between grid points and vehicles
1. Create grid points in QGIS
2. Select nearest neighbour for each grid point and calculate distance: [Nearest_Neighbour.sql](PostgreSQL/Nearest_Neighbour.sql)

Hint: is a classical nearest neighbour problem, but running it as bulk on a whole table is a bit tricky and furthermore timeconsuming (adjust config settings, see [Wiki] (https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Performance-Optimization-of-PostgreSQL)!)

 ## Create hexagons with POI density
 1. [Import shapefile](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Import-OSM-Data-into-a-PostGIS-Database) with POIs (point-layer from OSM)
 2. [Create](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Create-Hexagons-with-QGIS) and import hexagons
 3. Calculate sum of POIs for each hexagon: [POI_Density_Hexagon.sql](PostgreSQL/POI_Density_Hexagon.sql)

 ## Create hexagons with length of cycleway/pedestrian path
 **Option I - using QGIS:** see [wiki article](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Calculate-sum-of-cycleways-sidewalks-per-hexagon-in-QGIS)
 
 **Option II - using PostGIS:**
 1. [Import shapefile](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Import-OSM-Data-into-a-PostGIS-Database) with cycleways/sidewalks (from OSM)
 2. [Create](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/wiki/Create-Hexagons-with-QGIS) and import hexagons
 3. Calculate length of cycleways/sidewalks for each hexagon: [POI_Density_Hexagon.sql](PostgreSQL/Lenght_Lines_Hexagon.sql)

## Create hexagon with sales per day
1. Make shure that you have calculated sales for each trip (see [Calculate_Sales.sql](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/blob/master/Preparation/PostgreSQL/Calculate_Sales.sql))
2. Import kml-file with operating area (see ( [Add_Operating_Area_kml_with_ogr2ogr.txt](https://github.com/martindotlindner/carsharing/blob/master/Data/PostgreSQL/Add_Operating_Area_kml_with_ogr2ogr.txt)). You have to install gdal-bin first. With copy-paste of the command, I got an error message. By manuel typing the script worked fine.
3. Create an import a hexagon-layer.
